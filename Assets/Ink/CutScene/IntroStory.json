To make the controller for the game all you need is a printer, a webcam, popsicle sticks (or something similar), and tape!","\n","^In this game, you will be able to play as three seperate characters- each of which are outlined in the character cut-outs! To select which character you want to play as in your party, just hold up the marker of that character cutout to your camera. Make sure your lighting is good and that you can clearly see the markers in your webcam","\n","^To tell the character what to do, you will use the other, square cut-out. Apply it to your hand using tape. You will need to keep the marker flat, so to avoid it getting folded or wrinkled, use a cardboard backing and then tape the cardboard to your hand (or glove for easy re-application)","\n","^Now, welcome to the Iron Region!","\n",{"->":"Iron_Region"},["done",{"#f":5,"#n":"g-0"}],null],"done",{"Iron_Region":["^The Iron Region, formerly wealthy from a stable iron manufacturing economy, is now a shadow of its former self.

People had visions of their loves when they were younger. Visions of family, now deceased. Sadly, the Beholderite's effect was fleeting. Its power did not last, and there was never enough of it. One can only speculate the power of a great supply of Beholderite.","\n","^Because the effects of Beholderite are ephemeral, people went crazy to find more. To see those that they lost one more time. These desperate people did things that tore apart the fabric of society. Soon, not even the King and his army could hold things together.","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
