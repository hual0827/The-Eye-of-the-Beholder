:: Intro[START]
This is an alternative controller RPG. To make the controller for the game all you need is a printer, a webcam, popsicle sticks (or something similar), and tape!

In this game, you will be able to play as three seperate characters- each of which are outlined in the character cut-outs! To select which character you want to play as in your party, just hold up the marker of that character cutout to your camera. Make sure your lighting is good and that you can clearly see the markers in your webcam

To tell the character what to do, you will use the other, square cut-out. Apply it to your hand using tape. You will need to keep the marker flat, so to avoid it getting folded or wrinkled, use a cardboard backing and then tape the cardboard to your hand (or glove for easy re-application)

Now, welcome to the Iron Region!

[[The Iron Region intro]]

:: The Iron Region intro[ironRegion]
The Iron Region, formerly wealthy from a stable iron manufacturing economy, is now a shadow of its former self. While digging deeper and deeper to find iron, they discovered a mineral know as Beholderite.

Beholderite was a novelty. It channeled old, good memories into those who touched it. People had visions of their loves when they were younger. Visions of family, now deceased. Sadly, the Beholderite's effect was fleeting. Its power did not last, and there was never enough of it. One can only speculate the power of a great supply of Beholderite.

Because the effects of Beholderite are ephemeral, people went crazy to find more. To see those that they lost one more time. These desperate people did things that tore apart the fabric of society. Soon, not even the King and his army could hold things together.

Netrixi: Come on pirate, hand over the coil. It's not even yours! I mean, you're a pirate. We can do this the easy way or the hard way.

Folkvar: Please stop, Netrixi. We have been looking for you. You are under arrest for possession of Beholderite.

Oh please, come at me[[Netrixi fights Folkvar]]

Netrixi: This compass leads to the biggest supply of Beholderite in the Iron Region. 

Folkvar: That could not be! My father, the King, has secured all known Beholderite in the castle, and that does not point to our castle. 

Netrixi: Then we need to figure out what is going on. Someone might be hiding Beholderite.

Folkvar: You have a point. However, I must return to the castle and ask my father for permission. But Netrixi?

Netrixi: Yes, my Prince?

Folkvar: You will get many more slaps on the wrist if you are attempting to fool me.

Netrixi: I would never. But first, I need a drink. It's been a long day.

[[Tavern]]

:: Tavern[tavern]
Netrixi: Ahhh that's the stuff. The only thing that takes me back to my childhood like Beholderite does is a nice cold brew.

Folkvar: Your mind seems so tainted by Beholderite. How can you still function?

Netrixi: You learn some things when you're alive for hundreds of years.

Folkvar: Hmmm. Ok well we might need some extra help. Whoever has that Beholderite probably has it guarded. Shall we ask someone in the tavern to assist us?

Netrixi: Ah yes, let's take a look around... Oooo those two look promising. Who should we ask to join our party?

ask Brute[[ask Brute]]
ask Iv[[ask Iv]]

:: Folkvar is defeated[netrixiMansion]
Netrixi: Haha! Kneel, you mild mannered Prince!

Folkvar: I submit!

Netrixi: Now, you're going to help me find the Beholderite. 

Folkvar: Yes ma'am! However, I will need permission from my father. He will be very upset if I am not home by curfew. 

Netrixi: Fine, but I'll need to stop and get a drink along the way. It's been a long day.

:: Folkvar talks to Iv[tavern]
Folkvar: Well hello there, little lady! I hope you do not mind me saying but you look oddly out of place here!

Iv: I am a monk from the mountains to the East. I am looking for help in finding my brother. I believe he was taken as a slave to mine Beholderite.

Folkvar: By God! Excuse my language. Where do you think your brother was taken? By whom?

Iv: I hear rumors of a man named Moke. His only goal is Beholderite and he is accumulating much. The problem is, I have no idea where he was taken.

We can help each other![[Folkvar offers Iv help]]
Can you take care of yourself?[[Iv shows power]]

:: Netrixi talks to Iv[tavern]
Netrixi: Please don't waste my time.

:: Brute flips[tavern]
Folkvar: We have a lead on a large stash of Beholderite. Will you help us find it? We may run into trouble.

Brute: BEHOLDERITE?! I WILL DESTROY ANYONE WHO COMES BETWEEN ME AND BEHOLDERITE!!! WHERE IS IT?!

Folkvar: Ooo my mistake, I said been-holding-right... Simple mis-communication! please excuse me.

[[Resort to Iv]]

:: Brute prostitute[tavern]
Folkvar: I would like to purchase your services! With your size, and those muscles, I think we could really have some fun!

Netrixi: You're a psycho. Bye.

Iv: Watch this...

Netrixi: Wow I feel powerful!

Netrixi: What? What have you done to me? I'm weak.

Iv: I can do stuff like that.

Netrixi: WE NEED HER IN THE GANG!

[[Iv joins group]]

:: Iv joins group[tavern]
Netrixi: Alrighty, gang! Looks like we got everyone we need. Just one stop at the Castle because Folkvar has to ask daddy for permission.

Folkvar: I do not think I like your tone.

[[Ambush]]

:: Iv explains past[tavern]
Iv: I am a monk. I have trained my entire life to rid myself of worldly temptations. Beholderite simply does not phase me. 

Folkvar: Well then welcome aboard!

[[Iv joins group]]

:: Netrixi asks Iv why here[tavern]
Iv: I am a monk from the mountains to the East. I am looking for help in finding my brother. I believe he was taken as a slave to mine Beholderite.

Netrixi: Oooo that's rough. Wait, I didn't think there were Beholderite mines anymore. I thought they were all outlawed.

Iv: This man named Moke is running a secret operation. Still, it is very difficult to keep an operation that big a secret.

Netrixi: I think I might be able to find your brother. I just developed a compass that is pointing to the source of that Beholderite. The problem is...

How can I trust you?[[Iv explains past]]
It doesn't look like you can fight[[Iv shows power]]

:: Ambush[road]
Folkvar: Please, folks. Let us hurry! I have to be home soon! It took Netrixi took too long drinking!

Netrixi: I not did! Guys... Why are we pointing this way? The compass is going that way- 

Netrixi: Hey! That's my compass!

Iv: I know that mask! They are part of an underground group of assassins that will kill for Beholderite. I know where we can find them.

Folkvar: Perhaps we can get help from my father, the King. But right now, we need to get to the castle.

King: Brilliant! Do not delay. Go and bring that Beholderite back to me! I mean, the castle! So we can... uh store it in the vault? Yes, store it in the vault!

Folkvar: Your wish is my command, father.

:: Folkvar pursuades Assassin[tunnelEntrance]
Folkvar: I know you lot aren't bad folks! You're simply misunderstood! Work so hard, standing out here all day, but it's clear to see that you're both more emotionally repressed than a jar of pickles. You deserve more credit, which is why I'm offering you a position in my ranks?

Kaz: Well well well, what have we got here? Lost people wandering my halls?

Folkvar: He has my enchanted axe. It was a gift from my father... It is no wonder who is behind all this.
